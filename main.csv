"Timeliness, dealer tack on fees for documentation, etc... overall price of vehicle.  I have concerns that Ford Motor Company will still be in business in 10 years based on the 3 quotes I received for Ford dealers.  Your trucks are overpriced.  Relying heavily on overpriced Trucks/SUV is not sustainable over the long run.  Salaries have remained stagnate across the US since 2007 yet truck prices from Ford and GM have more than doubled.  I have 6 vehicles, last year I sold 2 Lincoln Navigators and replaced them with 2 Toyota 4Runners Limited 4x4.  I was able to purchase 2 Toyota for the price of 1 Lincoln Navigator. a foreign truck has beat out the F150 again this year.  Not because it's a better made truck but because it offers more VALUE for the $$$$.   $36K for a stripped down F150 4x4 Reg cab that should be priced around 27K is crazy.  Moving forward to future purchases, I will no longer consider Ford products.",End of Survey,TRUE,TRUE

"Generally, i do not have so much experience for now because i do not have any ford vehicle. But for now, i can get the information that i need so it looks good.

For example, in the web site they are publishing a discount lets say car price is 30K and they show 25K, but when i go to the dealer, they do not provide me 25K. they are adding extra costs and price of the car becomes 35K. (numbers are not real, just example, but ratio is similar.)If is there a chance to buy a ford from internet (mean not dealing with dealer) that may be more effective.

But by him actually breaking down the math for me, that actually told me that the ?special deal? was not a very special deal. And that he was also screwing me on my trade-in.
