"Timeliness, dealer tack on fees for documentation, etc... overall price of vehicle.  I have concerns that Ford Motor Company will still be in business in 10 years based on the 3 quotes I received for Ford dealers.  Your trucks are overpriced.  Relying heavily on overpriced Trucks/SUV is not sustainable over the long run.  Salaries have remained stagnate across the US since 2007 yet truck prices from Ford and GM have more than doubled.  I have 6 vehicles, last year I sold 2 Lincoln Navigators and replaced them with 2 Toyota 4Runners Limited 4x4.  I was able to purchase 2 Toyota for the price of 1 Lincoln Navigator. a foreign truck has beat out the F150 again this year.  Not because it's a better made truck but because it offers more VALUE for the $$$$.   $36K for a stripped down F150 4x4 Reg cab that should be priced around 27K is crazy.

GA has a statewide Ad Valorem tax which is the same for everyone. I'll assume they were not doing an unauthorized pull of my credit.
